# How To - Required software

## Introduction

This guide shows you how to setup a Mac for iOS development.

You will need a Mac in order to run this. It will not work on a Windows or Linux device.

## Xcode

You'll need an Apple ID in order to download Xcode - either through the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12). Or, if you're on the Apple Developer Program you can download separately through [this link](https://developer.apple.com/download/)).


Once installed, launch Xcode for the first time. 

A dialog will be presented showing which simulators are built-in and which simulators you may want to download. Download an iPhone simulator so that the app can run on your Mac.

You'll need to accept the terms and conditions that Apple present in order for Xcode to run.

You may see a dialog for installing Xcode Command Line Tools which you should accept to install them. 

Your Xcode installation and setup is now complete.
